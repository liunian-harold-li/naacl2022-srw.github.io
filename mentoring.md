# Mentoring

## Pre-submission Mentorship Program
The SRW offers students the opportunity to get advance feedback before submitting their work for review. The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality of writing and presentation of the studentâ€™s work, not to critique it. Participation is optional but encouraged and pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous.

Students wishing to participate must submit the paper by __December 11, 2020__ via e-mail to [naacl2021-srw@googlegroups.com](mailto:naacl2021-srw@googlegroups.com) along with the following included in the e-mail.

- E-mail subject: Pre-submission mentorship paper
- A copy of the paper (PDF format, anonymized, follow NAACL template)
- E-mail addresses of all authors (for correspondence)
- Author keywords and the area of the research (see [here](https://2021.naacl.org/calls/papers/) for relevant topics and areas)
- Any specific questions for mentors or expected types of feedback

Note that even though the mentoring is not done anonymously, the paper needs to be anonymized. We will check for formality of the paper including formatting before we match mentors.

Participants will receive a mentor who will review and provide feedback to the student within 4 weeks. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission. The feedback will be in the format of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing; students are not required to make the changes suggested by the pre-submission mentor.

<!-- ## Mentoring of Accepted Papers

There will also be mentors who provide feedback to students in the form of in-depth comments and questions for the workshop presentation. -->
