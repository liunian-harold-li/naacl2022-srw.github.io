# Author Guidelines
The ACL has released policies for submission, review and citation. Accompanying these are guidelines for authors. NAACL-HLT SRW 2019 will adhere to these policies and guidelines. Submissions should:

- __Be relevant__: Submissions to NAACL-HLT SRW 2019 should be relevant to the audience.
- __Be original__: The content of submissions to NAACL-HLT SRW 2019 (the ideas, the findings, the results and the words) should be original; that is, should not have been published (or be accepted for publication) in another refereed, archival form (such as a book, a journal, or a conference proceedings). Authors are referred to the ACL author guidelines for additional information on what constitutes existing publication.

Authors may present preliminary versions of their work in other venues that are not refereed and/or not archival (e.g. course reports, theses, non-archival workshops, or on preprint servers such as arXiv.org). Authors should list all such previous presentations in the submission form. This will help the area chairs if questions of originality arise.

## Double submission

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other venues must indicate this at submission time, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted to NAACL-HLT SRW 2019. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at NAACL-HLT SRW 2019 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented.

Authors submitting more than one paper to NAACL-HLT 2019 must ensure that the submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other. A given paper may only be submitted to a single NAACL-HLT 2019 track (Research, Industry, SRW or demos); any paper found to be submitted to more than one track will be rejected by all tracks. Resubmission to an appropriate workshop that follows the main conference is not affected by this policy.

## Pre-publication
The anonymity period for NAACL-HLT 2019 is from January 15, 2018 to March 1, 2019.

You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available online to the general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period.

You may not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.

## Facilitate double blind review

Double blind review is a form of peer review in which the identities of authors are not provided to reviewers, and the identities of reviewers are not provided to authors. To facilitate double blind review, submissions must not identify authors or their affiliations. For example, self-references that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …”.

Any preliminary non-archival versions of submitted papers should be listed in the submission form but not in the review version of the paper. NAACL-HLT SRW 2018 reviewers are generally aware that authors may present preliminary versions of their work in other venues, but will not be provided the list of previous presentations from the submission form.

Authors are referred to the [ACL author guidelines](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines) for additional information on how to facilitate double blind review.

## Accurately represent contributors

The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission to NAACL-HLT SRW 2019 will be notified of submissions, revisions and the final decision. No changes to the order or composition of authorship may be made to submissions to NAACL-HLT SRW 2019 after the abstract submission deadline.

## Describe research review and data management

If a submission describes work with a data set previously released by an organization or group (e.g. the LDC, ELRA, Kaggle), the source of the data should be appropriately referenced.

If a submission describes work with “found” data (e.g. data sampled from social media or the web), the source(s) of the data should be appropriately referenced, the method for sampling the data should be described, and any necessary permissions to use and/or release the data should be documented. In addition, the submission should document institutional review of the work as appropriate.

If a submission describes work involving human participants or personally identifiable information (including crowdsourced work), the submission should document institutional review of the work as well as informed consent and compensation procedures for participants, and anonymization procedures for the data.

## Accurately reference prior and related work

Submissions should accurately reference prior and related work, including code and data. If a piece of prior work appeared in multiple venues, the version that appeared in a refereed, archival venue should be referenced. If multiple versions of a piece of prior work exist, the one used by the authors should be referenced. Authors should not rely on automated citation indices to provide accurate references for prior and related work.

Authors are referred to the [ACL author guidelines](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines)  for additional information on how to appropriately cite prior work.

## Include appendices and supplementary resources as appropriate

Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents, code or data resources that are not available to the reviewers. NAACL-HLT SRW 2019 does encourage the submission of additional material that is relevant to the reviewers but not an integral part of the paper. There are two such types of material: appendices, which can be read, and non-readable supplementary materials, often data or code. Do not include this additional material in the same document as your main paper. Additional material must be submitted as one or more separate files, and must adhere to the same anonymity guidelines as the main paper. The paper must be self-contained: it is optional for reviewers to look at the supplementary material.

## Follow style and format guidelines

Submissions should follow the NAACL-HLT 2019 style guidelines. Long paper submissions must follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content. Short paper submissions must also follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings, and must not exceed four (4) pages. References do not count against these limits. We strongly recommend the use of the official NAACL-HLT 2019 style templates:

- [LaTeX](http://naacl2019.org/downloads/naaclhlt2019-latex.zip)
- [Microsoft Word](http://naacl2019.org/downloads/naaclhlt2019-word.zip)
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-naacl-hlt-2019-proceedings/xyyfwfkswhth)

__All submissions must be in PDF format.__

## Paper Submission

Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management.
