#### Q: Can I submit my non-archival accepted paper in other venues?
__A:__ Yes.

#### Q: In case the student author is unable to attend due to university examinations, is it possible for the equally contributing other author to apply for the travel grant? 
__A:__ Yes.

#### Q: Can I submit supplemental materials?
__A:__ We do not allow any supplemental appendices, and the paper should stand alone without requiring any appendices. However, we do allow supplemental code and data submissions. Submissions should be made through Softconf.

#### Q: Where should I submit for pre-submission mentoring?
__A:__ You may e-mail __naacl2021-srw@googlegroups.com__ with the follow information:

* A copy of the paper (PDF format, anonymized)
* E-mail addresses of all authors (for correspondence)
* Author keywords and the area of the research (see here for relevant topics and areas)
* Any specific questions for mentors or expected types of feedback

#### Q: What are the restrictions on the number of pages for a paper submitted to the Student Research Workshop? 
__A:__ See the NAACL-SRW author guidelines for page limits and submission information:
[Author Guidelines](https://naacl2021-srw.github.io/author)
 
#### Q: Double submission: where should it be mentioned that the paper will be submitted to other conference for reviewing?
__A:__ Double submission to the NAACL SRW and the main NAACL conference / other NAACL workshops is prohibited.
 
#### Q: If accepted, can a paper be published in the proceedings, even if it the student cannot take part at the workshop?
__A:__ The NAACL organizing team will attempt to provide travel grants to authors of all accepted papers. However, if things still don't work out, we can discuss remote presentation options should your paper be accepted.
 
#### Q: If the student is graduating before the mentoring/submission deadline, can they still submit to SRW?
__A:__ If the bulk of the work was done when the author was a student, it is acceptable to submit to SRW.
 
##### Q: If an author is to submit to the SRW in the non-archival tract, is it possible to resubmit to the main track of this year's ACL?
__A:__ The spirit of the SRW is to give you feedback to improve your work. If you submit to the mentoring deadline, the mentoring will prove useful. Otherwise, two days isn't much time to incorporate feedback for an ACL submission, so this goes against the spirit of the rule but is technically allowed. 

<!-- ### Q: When would it be possible to know the status of the grant to look into applying for a visa, other planning?
__A:__ We encourage to apply for visa soon and not to wait for the decision of travel grant. Visa application processes can take a long time. So start soon. -->

<!-- ### Q: What are the guidelines for the Camera-ready version?
__A:__ Camera ready FAQs are available [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-pub/blob/gh-pages/camera-ready-faq.md). -->
